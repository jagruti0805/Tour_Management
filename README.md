An Expense Tracker is a tool (like an app, spreadsheet, or software) used to record, categorize, and monitor how much money an individual or business spends.
Its main purpose is to provide clarity and insights into spending habits, helping users manage their budget, identify overspending, and ultimately achieve financial goals.
